# Spatial and trait analyses for Saxifragales
Scripts in this repository assume users have basic familiarity with conversion among common formats (csv to tsv, csv to shapefile, etc).

* Extract_point_values -- this folder contains the script we optimized to extract environmental conditions from large point datasets.

* BAMM -- this folder contains basic BAMM run input files (including trees and trait data) and scripts.

* BAMM_postprocessing -- this folder contains various post-processing scripts, such as producing rate-through-time plots and boxplots.

* biogeo -- this folder contains the script for automatically determining biogeographic coding from shape files. It is an improvement over inflexible and inefficient methods we found elsewhere.
